# Google Earth Engine workshop
This repository contains the mannual and code for Philip Kraaijenbrink's Google Earth Engine workshop

The exercises of this workshop are meant to give you an idea of the capabilities of Google Earth Engine. Some code uses intermediate to advanced concepts and because of the different level of the workshop participants, all code has been pre-written and ready for copy-paste. More advanced participants are encouraged to dive deeper into the code, add additional code, and find their own solutions, and help others in understanding the analyses and code.
