The exercises are meant to give you an idea of the capabilities of Google Earth Engine. Some code uses intermediate to advanced concepts and because of the different level of the workshop participants, all code has been pre-written and ready for copy-paste. More advanced participants are encouraged to dive deeper into the code, add additional code, and find their own solutions, and help others in understanding the analyses and code.

Workshop material:

-   [Introductory powerpoint slides](https://github.com/kraaijenbrink/earthengine-workshop/raw/main/earth-engine-workshop-intro-slides.pptx)

-   [Manual](https://kraaijenbrink.github.io/earthengine-workshop) (Gitbook hosted as a Github page from `./docs`, created using `bookdown`)

&nbsp;

All workshop code is available in `./code`. My [`earthengine-tools`](https://github.com/kraaijenbrink/earthengine-tools) repository contains additional functions that are called by the scripts in this manual.
